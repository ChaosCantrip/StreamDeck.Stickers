# Stream Deck Stickers Plugin
This is a plugin I made mainly for personal use.
The intention is to make it easier to send stickers in messaging apps that I have saved on my pc.  
I may consider building a proper release version in the future.
## nircmd
Since this was made for personal use, I ended up using an external utility. This plugin requires [nircmd](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) to be installed in the Windows directory of your machine, and as such the plugin only works on windows.  
This was done to make it easier to copy an image to the clipboard. If I find an accessible way to do this within node.js itself, I will most likely utilise it and release a full version.
## Installation
Under "Releases" you can find the file `com.chaoscantrip.stickers.streamDeckPlugin`. Running this file will install the plugin onto your Stream Deck.
